# RustyArchitecture
> A Rusty Architecture.

**Note:** This project is outdated and will not be continued. I am currently working on a better version where I also explain on YouTube how something like this works technically and maybe really build with breadboards, transistors etc... As soon as the new version is available, this Github repository will probably be deleted. It is possible that this code or the libraries have security vulnerabilities.
